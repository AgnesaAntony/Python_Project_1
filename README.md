# Python_Project_1
 This project involves analyzing a dataset of movie ratings to derive insights. The analysis includes handling missing values, exploring data patterns, and visualizing distributions.
# Data Description
 The dataset contains information about movies, including:
  Name: The title of the movie.
  Year: The release year of the movie.
  Duration: The duration of the movie in minutes.
  Genre: The genre(s) of the movie.
  Rating: The IMDb rating of the movie.
  Votes: The number of votes the movie received.
  Director: The director of the movie.
  Actor 1: The lead actor in the movie.
  Actor 2: The second lead actor in the movie.
  Actor 3: The third lead actor in the movie.
# Project Steps
# 1. Data Loading
    The dataset is loaded using the pandas library.
# 2. Data Cleaning
    Handling Missing Values: Missing values in numerical columns are filled with the median, and missing values in categorical columns are filled with 'Unknown'.
    Data Type Conversion: Numeric columns are converted to appropriate data types.
# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Summary Statistics: Basic summary statistics are computed for numerical columns.
    Visualizations: Various plots are created to visualize the distribution of ratings, the number of movies per genre, and the average ratings by genre.
# 4. Feature Engineering
    Primary Genre Extraction: The primary genre is extracted from the 'Genre' column.
    Actor Analysis: The frequency of actors appearing in the dataset is analyzed.
# Technologies Used
   Python: The primary programming language used for analysis.
   pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
# Results
  Data Cleaning: Successfully handled missing values and converted data types.
  EDA: Generated insights on the distribution of ratings, genre popularity, and actor appearances.
# Conclusion
 This project provides a comprehensive analysis of movie ratings, including data cleaning and exploratory analysis. The insights derived can be used to further understand   movie trends and make data-driven decisions.
